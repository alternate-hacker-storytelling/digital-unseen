They are so sensitive that a rod cell can detect a single photon of light — the smallest possible particle.

- title: Gaze detection
  notes: Various studies have explored the reliability with which humans can visually detect gazes from other individuals. Brain imaging has shown that the brain cells which are activated when a test subject can see that they are being stared at are distinct from the cells activated when the starer's eyes are averted away from the subject by just a few degrees[citation needed]. It is theorized that the ability to precisely detect the target of a starer's gaze has conferred an evolutionary advantage by improving threat detection capabilities, as well as facilitating nonverbal communication. Compared to the eyes of other animals, the uniquely visible and well-defined sclera and iris of human eyes provides further evidence of its evolutionary importance for the species, and are thought to have developed as humans became more reliant upon complex communication for survival and reproductive success.
  
- title: Catching Gaze of Others
  notes: “It's not just our brains that are specialized to draw us to the gaze of others,” Dempsey Jones wrote. “Our eyes are also exceptionally formed to catch attention and easily reveal the direction of gaze.” Human eyes are distinctive from the eyes of almost any other species in that we have a large white area around our pupils and irises, known as the sclera. As Dempsey-Jones noted, the sclera may make it easier for one human to detect the direction of the gaze of another. Why is this important? In a word, communication.
