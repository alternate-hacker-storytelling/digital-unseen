    and some algae, are composed of only one cell.
- name: Chemical
  description: A substance formed from two or more atoms that unite (bond) in a fixed
    proportion and structure. For example, water is a chemical made when two hydrogen
    atoms bond to one oxygen atom. Its chemical formula is H2O. Chemical also can
    be an adjective to describe properties of materials that are the result of various
    reactions between different compounds.

- name: Photopsin
  description: Cones have a pigment-protein pair called photopsin (Foh-TOP-sin). It
    comes in three different types, and each cone has just one type. They come in
    red, green or blue — the colors that each cone type is best at absorbing. Cones
    respond to light that has passed through the lens and onto the fovea. As each
    cone absorbs its color of light, it produces an electrical signal. These signals
    travel to the brain, filling our worlds with color
- name: Photopsin
  description: A pigment molecule bound to the light-sensing protein opsin. Photopsins
    are found in the cone cells of the eye and come in three types — red, blue and
    green. They also can sense white and black.
- name: Pigment
  description: A material, like the natural colorings in skin, that alter the light
    reflected off of an object or transmitted through it. The overall color of a pigment
    typically depends on which wavelengths of visible light it absorbs and which ones
    it reflects. For example, a red pigment tends to reflect red wavelengths of light
    very well and typically absorbs other colors. Pigment also is the term for chemicals
    that manufacturers use to tint paint.
- name: Protein
  description: A compound made from one or more long chains of amino acids. Proteins
    are an essential part of all living organisms. They form the basis of living cells,
    muscle and tissues; they also do the work inside of cells. Among the better-known,
    stand-alone proteins are the hemoglobin (in blood) and the antibodies (also in
    blood) that attempt to fight infections. Medicines frequently work by latching
    onto proteins.

    That second molecule can turn on some special activity by the cell.
- name: Refraction
  description: Refraction is the bending of light (it also happens with sound, water
    and other waves) as it passes from one transparent substance into another. This
    bending by refraction makes it possible for us to have lenses, magnifying glasses,
    prisms and rainbows. Even our eyes depend upon this bending of light.

  description: "(in biology) A type of eye cell that is part of the retina inside
    the back of the eye. These cells are rod shaped and sensitive to light. Although
    more sensitive to light than cone cells are, rods can not tell what color something
    is."

    social benefits, for example by sacrificing some individual freedom for state
    protection.
- name: Tissue
  description: Made of cells, it is any of the distinct types of materials that make
    up animals, plants or fungi. Cells within a tissue work as a unit to perform a
    particular function in living organisms. Different organs of the human body, for
    instance, often are made from many different types of tissues.

  description: The visual system is the part of the nervous system which allows organisms to see. It interprets the information from visible light to build a representation of the world surrounding the body. The visual system has the complex task of (re)constructing a three dimensional world from a two dimensional projection of that world. The psychological manifestation of visual information is known as visual perception. 
- name: Biological Clock
  description: A mechanism present in all life forms that controls when various functions
    such as metabolic signals, sleep cycles or photosynthesis should occur.

  description: Allowing light to pass through so that objects behind can be distinctly
    seenW
- name: Wavelength
  description: The distance between one peak and the next in a series of waves, or
    the distance between one trough and the next. It’s also one of the “yardsticks”
    used to measure radiation. Visible light — which, like all electromagnetic radiation,
    travels in waves — includes wavelengths between about 380 nanometers (violet)
    and about 740 nanometers (red).
