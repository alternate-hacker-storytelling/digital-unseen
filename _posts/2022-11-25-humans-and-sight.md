Jerome was all of a sudden very fascinated by how humans see. Most other animals rely on hearing, smell, and touch to make sense of the world them. Humans on the other hand, rely in large part on their vision. A large part of our cerebral cortex is devoted to seeing, and over the years we have developed and rely in large part on visual skills we've developed.

Seeing begins when light falls on the eyes, initiating the process of transaction. Once this visual information reaches the visual cortex, it is processed by a variety of neurons that detect colors, shapes, and motion, and that create meaningful perceptions out of the the incoming stimuli. Jerome's questions were around what type of light is exchanged, and how does our cumulative history and bias play a role in how we perceive light.

A whole lot can happen between light hitting our eye, and our brains processing what we saw. Secondarily, what happens once light hits our eyes? How much is reflected back out, and do any on these light waves contain information about what has been received. Meaning, is the light altered in any way if it hits the whites of our eyes? What role does familiar sights and faces shift how the light is processed or not processed. There are a lot of unkowns here, but things are beginning to come into focus.
