Molly couldn't take it anymore. The neighbor across the way has been standing in his window starting at her for weeks. She had gone to talk to the front desk for their building, but they hadn't gotten back to her with any response. 

She began closing all the blinds, except for the one window that overlooked the street and park below. That was the one way she still felt connected to the city, sitting in her chair and watching people throughout the day. They were far enough away that she couldn't see their faces, but she could still make out their personalities from their clothes and the way they walked.

Since Troy left, this tiny slice of the city was all that she could handle. Her neighbor had just narrowed that slice even further, but she still controlled the street below.
