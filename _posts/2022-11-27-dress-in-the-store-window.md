Molly walked by the store window twice a day. Once when she went to pickup her Starbucks Venti Mocha she ordered online as soon as the store opened, and then in the evening when she was heading to the vending machines that had her favorite chips out back behind the community college. Most of the outfits were out of her league and didn't appeal to here, but there was a blue dress there now that just spoke to here. She needed it. But this meant she had to go into the store. She looked for someone online purchasing option, but there was none. She would have to physically go into the store.
