The air around us is filled with a sea of electromagnetic energy: pulses of energy waves that can carry information from place to place. Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelength — the distance between one wave peak and the next wave peak — with the shortest gamma waves being only a fraction of a millimeter in length and the longest radio waves being hundreds of kilometers long. Humans are blind to almost all of this energy — our eyes detect only the range from about 400 to 700 billionths of a meter, the part of the electromagnetic spectrum known as the visible spectrum.
