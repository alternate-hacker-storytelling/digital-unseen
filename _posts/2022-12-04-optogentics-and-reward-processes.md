we optogenetically drove well-defined dopamine neurons in the mouse in different temporal patterns during free behavior, and found parameters that were sufficient to drive reinforced behavior (for example, in the absence of any other cue or reward, healthy animals simply chose to spend more time in places where they had received particular kinds of optogenetic bursting activity in dopamine neurons). This work is relevant to hedonic (pleasure-related) pathologies involved in depression (as in my depressed patient who could no longer even enjoy seeing her grandchildren, otherwise one of the most rewarding experiences known to humankind) and in substance abuse, as well as in healthy reward processes.
