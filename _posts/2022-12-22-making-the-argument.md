Jerome was determined to make his case without sounding crazy as he has several times before. He felt like he has done his homework this time, but the only way to find out was to try and convince Terry. He was the expert.

"So, what you are saying is there is some residual build-up each time someone is seen?" Terry pushed back.

"Yes, at a cellular level!" shot back Jerome. "Let's say you are walking on campus along the path to this building, and I am walking along the path across the way and I see you. First, I acknowledge at a a level more than just seeing that I've seen you. I recognize and know you. Now I also am looking at you, and at what point to you see me?"

"Do you see the whites of my eyes? Do you see both my eyes looking at you? Or was it at some point before? Either way, at some point at a cellular level you are impacted by this event, either because your brain acknowledged it, or what I am suggesting is that at a cellular level you received the light from my eyes gazing upon you, and you have some residual build-up of this each time it happens. Whether or not your brain acknowledges being seen."

"Next, image I was on the top floor of the library looking down through the window onto the courtyard and see you walking up the walkway." said Jerome. "You likely haven't seen my eyes or face, or know I am watching you. You might have a feeling you are being watched, or at least an assumption you are being watched. Regardless, does your body record this event and file it away?"

"Does the gazer do so at well even in the most casual of encounters?", added Jerome. "What I am saying is there is always an exchange. An exchange of light. Consciously or subconsciously, light is impacting us at a cellular level. A transaction of sorts has occurred, whether we know it or not.".

"I agree that light is impacting our cells in any given moment.", injected Terry. "But what you are saying is that there are numerous micro transactions of light occurring back and forth as we move through the world, and are you saying that these cumulatively add up to what is essentially our visibility, and even matter?"

"I agree, I don't have the evidence", conceded Jerome. "That is why I am here talking to you. I am just looking for answers to what my research has revealed. I am not looking for you to validate what I am saying out of the gate, just help me understand if it is possible or not. Could we be dependent on being seen by each to stay visible to each other? I know it sounds crazy, but is it within the realm of possibilities?"

"I don't know", puffed Terry. "It is pretty out there, but I'll admit there are a lot of things going on at the cellular level and with how we process and communicate with light that we don't understand. I guess it is within the realm of possibility, but damn it will take a lot of work to prove something like this."
