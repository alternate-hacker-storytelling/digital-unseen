In contrast, anonymity can be used as Isaacson argues- a tool for injustice. To support his argument, Isaacson employs Plato’s story, the Ring of Gyges, from Republic. When given a ring, a shepherd named Gyges becomes invisible and anonymous. Through his invisibility he seduces a queen, kills her king, and takes over the kingdom. Plato argues that the Ring of Gyges- invisibility and anonymity- is the only barrier between a just and an unjust person. He argues that we would all be unjust if we had a cloak of anonymity. Injustice is far more profitable. We are only just because it is necessary.
