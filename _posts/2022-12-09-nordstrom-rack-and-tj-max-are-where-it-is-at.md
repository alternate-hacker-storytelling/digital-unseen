Lauren most enjoyed, and made the most money from lifting things from Nordstrom Rack and T.J. Max. They have some of the best discounted items for brands that sell the best online. And clothes was way more fun to steal, because she had to do more of the "shopping" to look for just the right items.

Depending on the layout of the store, "shopping" for just the right items was an art. You don't want to look suspicious if someone saw you, but you wanted to blend in. Lauren knew what colors the walls of the store were painted, and understand where the cameras and checkout aisles were. She played it all.
