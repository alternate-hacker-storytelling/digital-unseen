When Tenillle moved through the world she was hyper aware of her place. She knew this in the online world and she knew it in the offline world. She was constantly aware of the footprint she left visually anywhere she went and recalled in a sort of photographic memory way, but more spatially, and the backdrop of a major movie motion picture.

Escaping notice need not be about complacent isolation, mindless conformity or humiliating anonymity. When circumstance confers invisibility upon us, perhaps it is something to appreciate and even welcome, as some iteration of the small imprint, low-impact living it makes sense to aspire to. Or possibly as a more profound poise, a fuller appreciation for our place in the greater scheme of things.

I think of the walking stick again. When it moves, its shadow is the shadow of a branch, its incremental motion suggesting nothing more than the breeze hitting a bit of bough. It may just be one ordinary thing disguised as another, but it has a lightness of being, a composure, and all the grace of going unseen.
