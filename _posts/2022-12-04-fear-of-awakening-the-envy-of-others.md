We are all unique in some way, with some special ability or natural gift that enables us to do things we would like to be recognized for. However, we know that if we stand out then that can cause envy in other people. If this happens then we will no doubt have to face criticism, judgments and rejections.

For some people, depending on their past experiences, this can be unbearable, as we tend to look to others for their approval. The desire to shine, but also the fear of doing so, causes us to find ourselves caught between two options. Either to shine and make ourselves and our abilities known, or to become invisible and follow other peopleâ€™s expectations.
