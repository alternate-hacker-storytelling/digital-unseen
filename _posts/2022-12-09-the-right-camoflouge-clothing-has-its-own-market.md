Laren still kept some of the clothing she lifted for herself, but about 85% of went to "The Market", an online bazaar of clothing stolen by the Unseen, for the Unseen. They were all of the colors that the Unseen knew protected them. The styles that didn't attract attention. The patterns that let blend into whatevever places they frequented.

While each member of the Unseen had their own understanding, preference, and even way of describing the hauls they sold online, as well as the hauls they kept for themselves. It was their armor. Their gear. It was 100% deliberate and intentional, and reflected, or more importantly did not reflect their relationship with the world around them.

Some Unseen Kids used eBay, others used Etsy, and some are using automated vending machines and social media of different flavors to only sell in their local areas. For some it was a hobby, for others it was a mission, and the level of detail shown it what was available and when showed.
