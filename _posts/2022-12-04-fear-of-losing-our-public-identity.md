If in our childhood our family has taught us that we don’t deserve anything that we receive, then it is very likely that we will grow up thinking and acting accordingly. In this way we may not only think that we don’t deserve a gift, but that we aren’t worthy of affection either. We will have adopted an identity of “no merit”.

Strangely, we are terrified of losing what we were told we were. We are scared of losing what we don’t really identify with, that identity that we have been almost obliged to accept. That’s why it’s so hard for us to make any sort of progress sometimes. We have built ourselves a world which functions according to who we think we are, and who we have been told we are. Because of this, and without realizing it, nor wanting to do so, we flee from any signs of affection.
