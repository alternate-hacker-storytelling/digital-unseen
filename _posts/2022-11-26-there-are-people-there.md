Downtown San Francisco has always been bustling. Market Street is a well-known marketplace of activity. Every time I've gone down to Market Street, the Embarcadero, and other familiar spots, they have been near empty. Covid, as well as a supposed mass exodus of technology workers has left downtown a ghost town. 

It wasn't until Jerome started suggesting that his research subjects meet with him downtown that he became more aware that maybe downtown San Francisco wasn't as empty as it appeared. In reality, there were many more individuals skulking between their house and a friends, or running an errand that didn't involve interaction with other human beings. Once you began looking there was a lot more people downtown.

Jerome felt he now had the proof. After weeks of bringing his Meshlium Scanner down to Market street and both digitally counting people using their cell and bluetooth signals, as well as physically counting people he saw, he had enough data to at least shift his views. The number of people counted by the Meshlium Scanner were always 5-7 times higher than the people he counted as he sat there on the bench. Granted, there are many reasons this could be, but after conducting various experiments at different times of day, it became clear that there were more people than he was seeing.

When Jerome counted people during business hours he average 5-7 times virtual count than the people count. When he counted around dusk and early evening he encountered 25-35 times the virtual count over the people he saw. This was consistent throughout the week, but lowered as the weekend approached. It seemed that people were heading out during these hours, but sitting on the bench watching you wouldn't know it. Sure there were plenty of people out, but nothing compared with what was being counted virtually via bluetooth and wireless connections.
