Downtown San Francisco has always been bustling. Market Street is a well-known marketplace of activity. Every time I've gone down to Market Street, the Embarcadero, and other familar spots, they have been near empty. Covid, as well as a supposed mass exodus of technology workers has left downtown a ghost town. 

It wasn't until Jerome started suggesting that his research subjects meet with him downtown that he became more aware that maybe downtown San Francisco wasn't as empty as it appeared. In reality, there were many more individuals skulking between their house and a friends, or running an errand that didn't involve interaction with other human beings. Once you began looking there was a lot more people downtown.
