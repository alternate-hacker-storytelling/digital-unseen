Sean really didn't want to be bothered with having a job, but his dad wouldn't pay his rent anymore. So, now he was forced to find only the amount of employment he needed to cover his rent, utilities, and food--he didn't have many other needs.

He had been employed at RiseTech, a big data company for a little over a year now. It was a completely remote gig for a company in another town. For the first six months he'd work about half time to make it look like he was a good employee, but after that he just pretty played the his games and chatted with his friends.

Now, after 14 months, he was quiet quitting. This is what he told his friends and talked about on Reddit. he was taking a stance against the man. Really, he just didn't feel like working or be bothered with quitting and looking for a new job--until he had to.
