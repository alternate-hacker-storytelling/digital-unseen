It seems disturbing to say, but Jerome was happy to move onto research involving online sex workers. It was an important area of research that will benefit humanity, but it was something he could do from mostly at home and online. But, most importantly he wouldn't have to go into those prison walls anymore to speak with prisoners who were languishing in solitary confinment.

Jerome had been doing research on the physical impacts of solitary confiment on prisoners, working to understand what it was doing to these human beings we've decided aren't worthy of being part of our world. His work had impacted legislation across 15 separate states, and had made a singificant impact on the world, but working in prisons each day was beginning to take a physical and mental toll on Jerome as well.

His new project was also funded by his department at the university where he worked, and sparked his interest because it was about the impacts of our online world. Jerome was a late bloomer when it came to the World Wide Web, but he has long been concerned about the impact the web was having on society. He was concerned enough to go online and better understand how the web worked, so he could take his brand of research online and help make sense of things--little did he know just how big this online world was, and how significant an impact it would have on all of us.
