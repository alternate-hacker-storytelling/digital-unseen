While Lauren is in the Unseen, and definitely considers herself a thief and a criminal, she doesn't see that as being bad. She uses her powers of invisibility for what she sees as good, leveling the playing field in an unjust society. 

Lauren steals to provide sleeping bags, clothes, and food for the homeless. She steals clothes and gives it to poor kids so they can go to school feeling proud. Lauren knows what it takes for her to survive, meets her minimum for what she needs within a few days of work, and the rest is for the cause--she considers herself a solider.
