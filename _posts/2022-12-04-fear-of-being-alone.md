The fear of being alone is a fear that affects many people. This is a belief that causes us to conform to what others think, just so that they will accept us. For example, if we are jokers or pranksters, but our friends are embarrassed about us, then we’ll try to change and repress that part of us, just so we don’t feel alone.

In short, we choose to be invisible so that others will accept us. However, we should ask ourselves: do we really want to be with people who don’t accept us as we really are? And yet being alone is like leaving our comfort zone. That is why we are so afraid of not finding more friends, a partner or a person who really accepts us.

Now, if we decide to change and blot out our real selves, then there’ll come a time when we’ll ask ourselves who we really are. Choosing to be like other people expect us to be is almost like a betrayal of ourselves. It is a type of rejection of our true self that will cause us great upset and unease in the long run. In order to rediscover ourselves, we’ll have to go through a process that will mean us having to face what we really fear. It will be a complex, but eventually satisfying, path when we finally reach that goal. There is nothing more beautiful than truly finding ourselves.
