Tira has become a stalker of indigenous hangouts in the bay area. She doesn't go in, she just watches. She is a shadow of what is happening in the community, sometimes even sitting in the back corner of the bar going unnoticed.

She watches men who are predators and zeroes in on one she thinks is killing indigenous women in her community. She uses her invisibility powers to protect the women in her community, and ultimately stalks him and kills him.
